The Mouse Models of Human Cancer Database (MMHCdb; http://tumor.informatics.jax.org [formerly known as the Mouse Tumor Biology (MTB) database]) provides users with online access to data regarding mouse models of human cancer, encompassing genetically engineered mouse models, inbred strain models, and Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models. Information in MMHCdb is obtained from curation of peer-reviewed scientific publications and from direct data submissions from individual investigators and large-scale programs. Enforcement of standard gene and strain nomenclature and use of controlled vocabularies within MMHCdb enables complete and accurate searching of the published literature for relevant mouse models. MMHCdb was established in 1997 and, over the years, has undergone several revisions of both its database structure and web interface. We recently undertook a comprehensive web redesign to provide better visualization tools and simplify the presentation of search results focusing on reducing textual redundancy. Reorganized displays for tumor frequency and strain cohort results now provide the user with cleaner, more informative layouts. Users now also have the option to send their found data set to the faceted browser for further data exploration. Addition of a tumor spectrum summary for each strain cohort enhances the utility of the search results page. Granular details for each tumor frequency and strain cohort record are still available by clicking through to the detail pages. The Quick Search functionality, shown at the top of each web page, was simplified and now allows users to query by tumor, strain cohort, genetic, or reference information in one simple field. MMHCdb is supported by NCI grant CA089713.},

To address this challenge, we utilize transfer learning to extract coordinated expression patterns and use learned patterns to analyze small rare disease datasets. We trained a pathway-level information extractor (PLIER) model on a large public data compendium comprising multiple experiments, tissues, and biological conditions and then transferred the model to small datasets in an approach we call MultiPLIER. Models constructed from the public data compendium included features that aligned well to known biological factors and were more comprehensive than those constructed from individual datasets or conditions. When transferred to rare disease datasets, the models describe biological processes related to disease severity more effectively than models trained only on a given dataset.},

Here, we describe how to accomplish such a reduction in dimension by a metagene projection methodology, which can greatly reduce the number of features used to characterize microarray data.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq allows researchers to identify cell populations based on unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome. However, subpopulations can have only subtle transcriptomic differences and the high dimensionality of the data makes their identification challenging.
RESULTS: We introduce ILoReg, an R package implementing a new cell population identification method that improves identification of cell populations with subtle differences through a probabilistic feature extraction step that is applied before clustering and visualization. The feature extraction is performed using a novel machine learning algorithm, called iterative clustering projection (ICP), that uses logistic regression and clustering similarity comparison to iteratively cluster data. Remarkably, ICP also manages to integrate feature selection with the clustering through L1-regularization, enabling the identification of genes that are differentially expressed between cell populations. By combining solutions of multiple ICP runs into a single consensus solution, ILoReg creates a representation that enables investigating cell populations with a high resolution. In particular, we show that the visualization of ILoReg allows segregation of immune and pancreatic cell populations in a more pronounced manner compared with current state-of-the-art methods.

@article{sanchez-pla_equivalence_2019,
	title = {An equivalence approach to the integrative analysis of feature lists},
	volume = {20},
	issn = {1471-2105},
	doi = {10.1186/s12859-019-3008-x},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although a few comparison methods based on the biological meaning of gene lists have been developed, the goProfiles approach is one of the few that are being used for that purpose. It consists of projecting lists of genes into predefined levels of the Gene Ontology, in such a way that a multinomial model can be used for estimation and testing. Of particular interest is the fact that it may be used for proving equivalence (in the sense of "enough similarity") between two lists, instead of proving differences between them, which seems conceptually better suited to the end goal of establishing similarity among gene lists. An equivalence method has been derived that uses a distance-based approach and the confidence interval inclusion principle. Equivalence is declared if the upper limit of a one-sided confidence interval for the distance between two profiles is below a pre-established equivalence limit.
RESULTS: In this work, this method is extended to establish the equivalence of any number of gene lists. Additionally, an algorithm to obtain the smallest equivalence limit that would allow equivalence between two or more lists to be declared is presented. This algorithm is at the base of an iterative method of graphic visualization to represent the most to least equivalent gene lists. These methods deal adequately with the problem of adjusting for multiple testing. The applicability of these techniques is illustrated in two typical situations: (i) a collection of cancer-related gene lists, suggesting which of them are more reasonable to combine -as claimed by the authors- and (ii) a collection of pathogenesis-based transcript sets, showing which of these are more closely related. The methods developed are available in the goProfiles Bioconductor package.
CONCLUSIONS: The method provides a simple yet powerful and statistically well-grounded way to classify a set of genes or other feature lists by establishing their equivalence at a given equivalence threshold. The classification results can be viewed using standard visualization methods. This may be applied to a variety of problems, from deciding whether a series of datasets generating the lists can be combined to the simplification of groups of lists.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-seq, wherein RNA transcripts expressed in a sample are sequenced and quantified, has become a widely used technique to study disease and development. With RNA-seq, transcription abundance can be measured, differential expression genes between groups and functional enrichment of those genes can be computed. However, biological insights from RNA-seq are often limited by computational analysis and the enormous volume of resulting data, preventing facile and meaningful review and interpretation of gene expression profiles. Particularly, in cases where the samples under study exhibit uncontrolled variation, deeper analysis of functional enrichment would be necessary to visualize samples' gene expression activity under each biological function.
RESULTS: We developed a Bioconductor package rgsepd that streamlines RNA-seq data analysis by wrapping commonly used tools DESeq2 and GOSeq in a user-friendly interface and performs a gene-subset linear projection to cluster heterogeneous samples by Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Rgsepd computes significantly enriched GO terms for each experimental condition and generates multidimensional projection plots highlighting how each predefined gene set's multidimensional expression may delineate samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The rgsepd serves to automate differential expression, functional annotation, and exploratory data analyses to highlight subtle expression differences among samples based on each significant biological function.},

	abstract = {Evaluating the differential expression of a set of genes belonging to a common biological process or ontology has proven to be a very useful tool for biological discovery. However, existing gene-set association methods are limited to applications that evaluate differential expression across k⩾2 treatment groups or biological categories. This limitation precludes researchers from most effectively evaluating the association with other phenotypes that may be more clinically meaningful, such as quantitative variables or censored survival time variables. Projection onto the Orthogonal Space Testing (POST) is proposed as a general procedure that can robustly evaluate the association of a gene-set with several different types of phenotypic data (categorical, ordinal, continuous, or censored). For each gene-set, POST transforms the gene profiles into a set of eigenvectors and then uses statistical modeling to compute a set of z-statistics that measure the association of each eigenvector with the phenotype. The overall gene-set statistic is the sum of squared z-statistics weighted by the corresponding eigenvalues. Finally, bootstrapping is used to compute a p-value. POST may evaluate associations with or without adjustment for covariates. In simulation studies, it is shown that the performance of POST in evaluating the association with a categorical phenotype is similar to or exceeds that of existing methods. In evaluating the association of 875 biological processes with the time to relapse of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, POST identified the well-known oncogenic WNT signaling pathway as its top hit. These results indicate that POST can be a very useful tool for evaluating the association of a gene-set with a variety of different phenotypes.

Currently, a limited number of computational tools are available for this task, and quantitative methods for comparing different tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell Analysis (TSCAN) is a software tool developed to better support in silico pseudo-Time reconstruction in Single-Cell RNA-seq ANalysis. TSCAN uses a cluster-based minimum spanning tree (MST) approach to order cells. Cells are first grouped into clusters and an MST is then constructed to connect cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained by projecting each cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence of cells can be used to study dynamic changes of gene expression along the pseudo-time. Clustering cells before MST construction reduces the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to improved cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently adjust the ordering based on prior knowledge. TSCAN has a graphical user interface (GUI) to support data visualization and user interaction. Furthermore, quantitative measures are developed to objectively evaluate and compare different pseudo-time reconstruction methods.

In this study we used critical network topology descriptors and guilt-by-association rule to explore and understand the significant molecular players, drug targets and underlying biological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. Analyzing two post-mortem brain gene microarrays (GSE4757 and GSE28146) with Pathway Studio software package we constructed and analyzed a set of protein-protein interaction, as well as miRNA-target networks. In a 4-step procedure the expression datasets were normalized using Robust Multi-array Average approach, while the modulation of gene expression by the disease was statistically evaluated by the empirical Bayes method from the limma Bioconductor package. Representative set of 214 seed-genes (p{\textless}0.01) common for the three brain sections of the two microarrays was thus created. The Pathway Studio analysis of the networks built identified 15 new potential AD-related genes and 17 novel AD-involved microRNAs. Using KEGG pathways relevant in Alzheimer's disease we built an integrated mechanistic network from the interactions between the overlapping genes in these pathways. Routes of possible disease initiation process were thus revealed through the CD4, DCN, and IL8 extracellular ligands. DAVID and IPA enrichment analysis uncovered a number of deregulated biological processes and pathways including neuron projection/differentiation, aging, oxidative stress, chemokine/ neurotrophin signaling, long-term potentiation and others.

	abstract = {: Diffusion maps are a spectral method for non-linear dimension reduction and have recently been adapted for the visualization of single-cell expression data. Here we present destiny, an efficient R implementation of the diffusion map algorithm. Our package includes a single-cell specific noise model allowing for missing and censored values. In contrast to previous implementations, we further present an efficient nearest-neighbour approximation that allows for the processing of hundreds of thousands of cells and a functionality for projecting new data on existing diffusion maps. We exemplarily apply destiny to a recent time-resolved mass cytometry dataset of cellular reprogramming.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: destiny is an open-source R/Bioconductor package "bioconductor.org/packages/destiny" also available at www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/destiny A detailed vignette describing functions and workflows is provided with the package.

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-015-0811-x},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detection of regulatory regions in candidate sequences is essential for the understanding of the regulation of a particular gene and the mechanisms involved. This paper proposes a novel methodology based on information theoretic metrics for finding regulatory sequences in promoter regions.
RESULTS: This methodology (SIGMA) has been tested on genomic sequence data for Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. SIGMA has been compared with different publicly available alternatives for motif detection, such as MEME/MAST, Biostrings (Bioconductor package), MotifRegressor, and previous work such Qresiduals projections or information theoretic based detectors. Comparative results, in the form of Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, show how, in 70\% of the studied Transcription Factor Binding Sites, the SIGMA detector has a better performance and behaves more robustly than the methods compared, while having a similar computational time. The performance of SIGMA can be explained by its parametric simplicity in the modelling of the non-linear co-variability in the binding motif positions.
CONCLUSIONS: Sequence Information Gain based Motif Analysis is a generalisation of a non-linear model of the cis-regulatory sequences detection based on Information Theory. This generalisation allows us to detect transcription factor binding sites with maximum performance disregarding the covariability observed in the positions of the training set of sequences. SIGMA is freely available to the public at http://b2slab.upc.edu.},

Ces travaux sont en particulier motivés par la classification de gènes à partir de données transcriptomes. Dans les deux parties de cette thèse, le problème est ramené à celui de la sélection de modèles.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Dans la première partie, le modèle proposé, généralisant celui de Raftery et Dean (2006) permet de spécifier le rôle des variables vis-à-vis du processus de classification. Ainsi les variables non significatives peuvent être dépendantes d'une partie des variables retenues pour la classification. Ces modèles sont comparés grâce à un critère de type BIC. Leur identifiabilité est établie et la consistance du critère est démontrée sous des conditions de régularité. En pratique, le statut des variables est obtenu grâce à un algorithme imbriquant deux algorithmes descendants de sélection de variables pour la classification et pour la régression linéaire. L'intérêt de cette procédure est en particulier illustré sur des données transcriptomes. Une amélioration de la modélisation du rôle des variables, consistant à répartir les variables déclarées non significatives entre celles dépendantes et celles indépendantes des variables significatives pour la classification, est ensuite proposée pour pallier une surpénalisation de certains modèles. Enfin, la technologie des puces à ADN engendrant de nombreuses données manquantes, une extension de notre procédure tenant compte de l'existence de ces valeurs manquantes est suggérée, évitant leur{\textless}br /{\textgreater}estimation préalable.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Dans la seconde partie, des mélanges gaussiens de formes spécifiques sont considérés et un critère pénalisé non asymptotique est proposé pour sélectionner simultanément le nombre de composantes du mélange et l'ensemble des variables pertinentes pour la classification. Un théorème général de sélection de modèles pour l'estimation de densités par maximum de vraisemblance, proposé par Massart (2007), est utilisé pour déterminer la forme de la pénalité. Ce théorème nécessite le contrôle de l'entropie à crochets des familles de mélanges gaussiens multidimensionnels étudiées. Ce critère dépendant de constantes multiplicatives inconnues, l'heuristique dite "de la pente" est mise en oeuvre pour permettre une utilisation effective de ce critère.},

Matrix factorization (MF) techniques can reveal low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data that reflect these interactions.

We review exemplary applications of MF for systems-level analyses. We discuss appropriate applications of these methods, their limitations, and focus on the analysis of results to facilitate optimal biological interpretation. The inference of biologically relevant features with MF enables discovery from high-throughput data beyond the limits of current biological knowledge – answering questions from high-dimensional data that we have not yet thought to ask.},

	abstract = {The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available ‘omics data coming from different sources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature’) to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.},

	abstract = {Most gene expression datasets generated by individual researchers are too small to fully benefit from unsupervised machine learning methods. In the case of rare diseases, there may be too few cases available, even when multiple studies are combined. To address this challenge, we utilize transfer learning to extract coordinated expression patterns and use learned patterns to analyze small rare disease datasets. We trained a Pathway Level Information ExtractoR (PLIER) model on a large public data compendium comprising multiple experiments, tissues, and biological conditions then transferred the model to small datasets in an approach we call MultiPLIER. Models constructed from the public data compendium included features that aligned well to known biological factors and were more comprehensive than those constructed from individual datasets or conditions. When transferred to rare disease datasets, the models describe biological processes related to disease severity more effectively than models trained only on a given dataset., 
          
        , Building models of gene expression with machine learning techniques can reveal key regulatory processes that go awry in disease. However, certain datasets are too small to support detailed models. We find that models can be trained on a large, public compendia of gene expression data and then transferred to datasets of interest, including rare disease datasets, to reveal consistent disease-associated patterns across datasets and tissues.},

	abstract = {Leaf senescence is an essential developmental process that impacts dramatically on crop yields and involves altered regulation of thousands of genes and many metabolic and signaling pathways, resulting in major changes in the leaf. The regulation of senescence is complex, and although senescence regulatory genes have been characterized, there is little information on how these function in the global control of the process. We used microarray analysis to obtain a high-resolution time-course profile of gene expression during development of a single leaf over a 3-week period to senescence. A complex experimental design approach and a combination of methods were used to extract high-quality replicated data and to identify differentially expressed genes. The multiple time points enable the use of highly informative clustering to reveal distinct time points at which signaling and metabolic pathways change. Analysis of motif enrichment, as well as comparison of transcription factor (TF) families showing altered expression over the time course, identify clear groups of TFs active at different stages of leaf development and senescence. These data enable connection of metabolic processes, signaling pathways, and specific TF activity, which will underpin the development of network models to elucidate the process of senescence.},

In this paper, we present GEM2Net, a new module of CATdb that takes advantage of this homogeneous dataset to mine co-expression units and decipher Arabidopsis gene functions. GEM2Net explores 387 stress conditions organized into 18 biotic and abiotic stress categories. For each one, a model-based clustering is applied on expression differences to identify clusters of co-expressed genes. To characterize functions associated with these clusters, various resources are analyzed and integrated: Gene Ontology, subcellular localization of proteins, Hormone Families, Transcription Factor Families and a refined stress-related gene list associated to publications. Exploiting protein-protein interactions and transcription factors-targets interactions enables to display gene networks. GEM2Net presents the analysis of the 18 stress categories, in which 17,264 genes are involved and organized within 681 co-expression clusters.

The sequencing effort has been coordinated by an international collaboration, the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI). The rationale for intensive investigation of Arabidopsis is that it is an excellent model for higher plants. In order to maximize use of the knowledge gained about this plant, there is a need for a comprehensive database and information retrieval and analysis system that will provide user-friendly access to Arabidopsis information.

The database uses Pathway Tools software, which allows the users to visualize a bird's eye view of all pathways in the database down to the individual chemical structures of the compounds. The database was built using Pathway Tools' Pathologic module with MetaCyc, a collection of pathways from more than 150 species, as a reference database. This initial build was manually refined and annotated. More than 20 plant-specific pathways, including carotenoid, brassinosteroid, and gibberellin biosyntheses have been added from the literature. A list of more than 40 plant pathways will be added in the coming months. The quality of the initial, automatic build of the database was compared with the manually improved version, and with EcoCyc, an Escherichia coli database using the same software system that has been manually annotated for many years. In addition, a Perl interface, PerlCyc, was developed that allows programmers to access Pathway Tools databases from the popular Perl language.

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions.

The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools.
